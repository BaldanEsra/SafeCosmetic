# SAFE COSMETICS
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>

#### Description:
I would like to give you brief information about the application I developed.
First of all, the purpose of this application is to make the content information of the cosmetic products we use in our daily lives more meaningful and to contribute to the protection of people's health.
Many people do not know what the chemicals they see in the product content mean. Isn't that the aim of the manufacturers anyway? To sell more products!
Thanks to this application I developed, users will be able to categorize the content information they enter into the application as harmful, very harmful or clean content.
For example, I do not know what the "Retinol" substance I see in the content is. I immediately enter retinol into the application and query it. And I see that it is very harmful.
Or let's do a query for xxx. It is on the gray list. It is better not to use it.
Okay, let's check for yyyy... Great. This substance is not harmful...
I hope this application will be beneficial to people for a healthier future and a quality life.
